Kernel-checked bridge from a repeat budget, or a bound at every capacity, to
mortality of the auxiliary Z-frontier, with the survival inequality proved
rather than assumed.

The objects are finite frontiers, words over `{0,1,2,3}` stored as bit pairs
`(a, b)` with `w_i = 2 a_i + b_i`, and the partial update `Z` of
RESULTS-variable-length-episode-composition.md: a left-to-right scan that
succeeds exactly when its final `u` and `v` agree, emits that common value as
the scalar and appends the birth symbol `(1, 1 XOR s)`. `run` iterates `Z` and
keeps every earlier guard, which is the chronological-guard condition.

Proved, for every legal frontier and with no finite computation assumed:

* `reconstruction`: after `n` updates the bit at depth `d` is the formal field
  of the emitted scalars once `n ≥ 1 + floor(d/2)` (high) or `1 + ceil(d/2)`
  (low), and one step earlier from an onset whose terminal high bit is one;
* `runBound`: a run with no repeated scalar from length `a` has length at most
  `a + 3`, and at most `a + 1` when the terminal high bit is one. The
  period-28 table of RESULTS-repeat-budget-lower-bound.md is evaluated inside
  the kernel by `decide`;
* `survival`: `r + N + 1 ≤ 2^(D+1) (r + 2)` on every successful prefix;
* `budgetAt_iff_mortalAt`, `budget_iff_mortality`: a repeat budget at length
  `r` is mortality at length `r`, in both directions;
* `mortality_of_capacity_budget`: a repeat bound at every capacity `K` gives
  mortality, for every capacity function `Q` at once and so for `Q_2`.

Control, `survival_counting_fails_without_runBound`: the counting inequality
is false for tapes in general, so the run bound is what carries it.

Nothing here proves a budget, a capacity bound or mortality. No `sorry`,
`native_decide`, added axiom or imported certificate; the `#print axioms`
lines at the end list the standard axioms each result uses.

/-! ## Reconstruction thresholds -/

/-
Proof of `Reconstruction`. Write A_d(n), B_d(n) for the bits of `atDepth` at depth d after n
successful updates, s for the scalar of the last update, out for the emitted symbols of its scan.
(1) Z w = some (w2, s) gives w2 = out ++ [(1, !s)], so atDepth w2 0 = (1, !s), and the last
    emitted symbol is the final (u, v) = (s, s), so atDepth w2 1 = (s, s) when w is nonempty
    (`scan_last`, `Z_depth`).
(2) Adjacent scan sites k, k+1 satisfy u_k = u_(k+1) XOR (v_(k+1) OR a_(k+1)) and
    v_k = v_(k+1) XOR (a_k OR b_(k+1)). Site k+1 has depth d in out and in w, site k depth d+1,
    and out sits one deeper in w2, which is `scan_depth_rec` and the last clause of `Z_depth`:
    A_(d+2)(n+1) = A_(d+1)(n+1) XOR (B_(d+1)(n+1) OR A_d(n)),
    B_(d+2)(n+1) = B_(d+1)(n+1) XOR (A_(d+1)(n) OR B_d(n)).
(3) FG W d (j+1) = FG (W o succ) d j (`FG_shift`) and window (t ++ [s]) o succ = window t, so
    FG (window (t ++ [s])) d (j+1) = FG (window t) d j with no side condition
    (`FG_window_snoc`). The junk value `false` beyond the tape is therefore never compared.
(4) `recon_aux`: induction on n, inside it a two-step induction on d. The threshold of
    A_(d+2)(n+1) is that of A_d(n) and implies those of A_(d+1)(n+1), B_(d+1)(n+1); the threshold
    of B_(d+2)(n+1) is that of B_d(n) and implies those of B_(d+1)(n+1), A_(d+1)(n). Base n = 0:
    only the terminal-high clause at d = 0 is satisfiable, and A_0(0) = terminalHigh w.
`Legal w` is not used.

/-! ## Alternating-run bounds -/

/-
Proof plan.
1. Run bookkeeping: a successful run of length n+1 is a successful run of length n followed by
   one successful Z, the tape grows by a snoc; Z keeps Legal, keeps site 0 and adds one symbol.
2. A tape with no repeat is alternating, so its window agrees below the tape length with the
   genuinely alternating signal `alt c`, c the last scalar.
3. Dependency: (FG W d j).1 reads W i only for j <= i < j + (d+1)/2 and (FG W d j).2 only for
   j <= i < j + 1 + d/2. At time n >= a and depth d = a+n-1 both bounds are <= n.
4. For the alternating signal, A c d = FG (alt c) d 0 obeys a closed two-row recurrence coupling
   the phases c and !c; the four-symbol state has period 28 (decide), so A c d = A c (d % 28).
5. Finite facts over one period (decide): no four consecutive depths, and no three consecutive
   depths from an odd depth, carry (true, beta) along the phase-alternating diagonal.
6. Reconstruction pins site 0, which is (true, beta) forever, to A (last scalar) (a+n-1).

/-! ## The survival inequality -/

/-
Proof of `survival_of_runBound`, written out before the Lean.

Write r = w.length. Cut the successful tape immediately before each repeated scalar. The
current (last) block is a run of l >= 1 updates from an onset frontier wq reached after m
updates, m + l = N, and its tape has no repeat. Invariant carried by induction on N:

    r + m + 1 <= 2^D (r + 2),   and   r + m + 1 <= 2^D (r + 1) when terminalHigh w,

with D = repeats tape. For m = 0 it is trivial. Appending a scalar s after last scalar a:
  * s != a: D and m are unchanged, the block grows to l + 1 and is still repeat-free.
  * s  = a: D grows by one and the new onset is m' = m + l = N. RunBound on the closed block
    gives l <= |wq| + 1 = r + m + 1 when m >= 1, because wq is then a successful image and its
    last symbol is the birth symbol (1, _); for m = 0 it gives l <= r + 3, or l <= r + 1 under
    terminalHigh w. Either way r + m' + 1 <= 2 (r + m + 1) <= 2^(D+1) (r + 2), resp. (r + 1),
    using 2^D >= 1 in the m = 0 case.
The same block estimate applied to the unfinished last block is the Survival inequality.

/-! ## Budget, mortality and capacity -/

/-
Proof plan.

(1) run w (n+1) unfolds by definition; a `none` at depth n stays `none` at n+1, hence at every
    M ≥ n (induction on the gap).
(2) A successful run of N updates emits exactly N scalars: tape.length = N (induction on N).
(3) repeats tape ≤ tape.length (structural induction, two-step).
(4) horizon_of_budget: if run w N = some (w', tape) with N beyond the horizon, then N ≥ 1, Survival
    gives r + N + 1 ≤ 2^(D+1)(r+2) ≤ 2^(B+1)(r+2) since D ≤ B; contradiction by omega.
(5) mortalAt_of_budgetAt, mortal_of_capacity_budget: instantiate the horizon.
(6) budgetAt_of_mortalAt: the words of length r over four symbols form an explicit finite list
    allWords r, complete by induction. Over an explicit list l, if every member satisfying C dies
    then one bound B covers all deaths (induction on l, max of the bounds). A successful run of
    length N from w with death time N_w ≤ B has N < N_w by (1), so repeats tape ≤ N < B by (2),(3).
(7) The control: alternating tape of length 10 with r = 1 has D = 0 and 12 > 6.
